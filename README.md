# C-Practice
This is a collection of C programs I’ve written while learning and practicing programming.  
The goal of this repository is simple: to build a solid foundation in C through hands-on coding and gradually explore more advanced concepts.

The repository is organized into folders for clarity:
- **Basics** → Beginner-friendly programs such as:
  - Calculating the area of a circle
  - Finding the average of numbers
  - Temperature and unit conversions
 
If you’d like to try out these programs yourself-

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kshapaksha/C-Practice.git
   cd C-Practice
2. Move into the folder where the program is located. Example:
   cd Basics
3. Compile the program using GCC:
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name


I’m using this repo to 
1.Strengthen my fundamentals in C 
2.Document my progress in programming
3.Create a reference I can revisit later
4.Share my learning journey with others


This is primarily a personal learning repo, but if you spot mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Feedback is always welcome.
